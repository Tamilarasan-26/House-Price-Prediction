🏠 House Price Prediction
📖 Overview

This project focuses on predicting house prices using machine learning techniques.
The aim is to analyze housing data, identify important features, and build models that can accurately estimate property prices.

🎯 Objectives

Understand the factors affecting house prices

Build predictive machine learning models

Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics

Improve model reliability using validation techniques

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python was used as the programming language along with libraries such as Pandas and NumPy for data processing, Scikit-learn for machine learning, and Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization.

🔬 Methodology

The project started with data preprocessing, including handling missing values and preparing the dataset.
Exploratory Data Analysis was performed to understand patterns and relationships.
Relevant features were selected before training the models.
Cross-validation was applied to ensure model stability, and hyperparameter tuning was performed for the Random Forest model.
Finally, model performance was evaluated using statistical metrics.

🤖 Models & Performance

Two machine learning models were implemented and evaluated.

Linear Regression achieved an R² score of 0.91, showing strong predictive capability and indicating a significant linear relationship between features and house prices.

Random Forest Regressor achieved an R² score of 0.84 after applying cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning.
Although it performed well, Linear Regression produced better results on this dataset.

Based on performance comparison, Linear Regression was selected as the final model.

📊 Evaluation Metrics

Model performance was evaluated using R² Score, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean Squared Error (MSE).

📁 Project Structure

The repository contains folders for data, notebooks, source code, and saved models along with the README and requirements file.

🚀 How to Run

Clone the repository, install the required dependencies, and run the notebook or script to reproduce the results.

📌 Key Takeaways

This project demonstrates the complete machine learning workflow from data preprocessing to model evaluation.
It highlights how simpler models like Linear Regression can sometimes outperform complex models depending on the dataset.
